## Introduction

The **Walking Bass** is one of the key stilistic elements of Jazz.
You will find it, for example, in Frank Sinatras famous interpretation of the jazz standard 
["Fly Me to The Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEcqHA7dbwM).

Outside of Jazz, the Walking Bass found great usage in the 50's in many Rock'n'Roll songs. 
Even in pop music, every now and then a Walking Bass sneaks into the top charts. Two examples are:
1. [The Beatles - All My Loving (1963)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEcqHA7dbwM)
2. [Queen - Crazy Little Thing Called Love (1980)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEcqHA7dbwM)

## Music Theory

This article assumes a basic understanding of music theory. You should know what scales are and how to build chords from them. If you don't, you can still **use** the algorithm, in which case I suggest you skip to the next chapter.

In this chapter, I hope to give you a basic understanding of what a Walking Bass does and how it can be composed within a certain set of constraints. Remember that part of what makes music so interesting is that these constraints or rules can be broken in creative ways to produce new things. However, the algorithm won't. It will 100% obey to the rules I will now define.
